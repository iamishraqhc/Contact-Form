This is a fully functional Contact Form made with Nodejs and MySQL database. The configuration for sending emails needs the email id and password to be placed in the .env file in the fields USER and PASS. I have included the sql file as well which can be imported from phpmyadmin. To run this application, at first, you need to give the command "npm i" and then run "npm run dev" or "npm run start". I have removed the node_modules folder as it is too big to include in the zip folder. Running "npm i" will bring the required node_modules folder.
